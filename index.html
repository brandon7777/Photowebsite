									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>Virginia Tech is an incredibly busy campus during the school year, especially in October. Students working and moving; roads packed with cars; bus stops crowded with passengers eager to get home. Nonetheless, you always see people in Blacksburg. But what does Virginia Tech look like when nobody is around to fill the space? 
                                        This photo gallery captures almost eerie images of locations on and around the Virginia Tech campus without people all around them. While many of these places are usually crowded, we associate them to always be crowded. Depopulated, these locations take on a completely new light and provide a very unique perspective.    </p>
